# Why we are keeping this file

As of today (2025-09-18), the latest version WordPress Playground is using
the WP core version of the WordPress Importer plugin and no longer needs
the Humanmade fork we were using and hosting at
https://playground.wordpress.net/wordpress-importer.zip.
However, there are older versions of Playground out there, including self-hosted
instances that still depend on that importer URL.

Let's keep serving the last-used version of that wordpress-importer.zip
for such users until we are able make self-hosted instances truly independent
of playground.wordpress.net resources.
